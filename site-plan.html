      <p>
        People will come to my site to learn one of three languages: French, Spanish, or English. <br>The site will answer the questions of price and how to set up appointments with me.</br><br> They will want to use my site because I offer all three languages on one site.</br> <br>They will be one on one lessons that will be through me and not pre-programmed apps.</br><br> I will be available to give online classes as well as in person if available.</br><br> People often feel like language learning apps do not really help and programs have a harder time knowing where you are actually at. Nothing beats having an actual teacher.</br><br> They would have someone to practice with automatically by scheduling lessons with me. Languages require a lot of practical practice in order to actually learn it.</br><br> That is part of why people do not feel like apps are as helpful. The availability in my schedule will be pretty open to people everywhere in the word.</br><br> I will also have learning tips and songs in the other languages that I like that they can listen to. Newcomers in the United States need basic knowledge into whatever field they are specifically going into and I can help with that as well.</br> <br>They can plan as many lessons as they would like to have throughout the week. Being at least bilingual is essential to expanding our view of the world.</br><br> How global the world is today with trade and business are also reasons why language learning is essential. It will make traveling easier.</br><br> People often try to learn the basics of a language before traveling to that country because of that. Learning a different language also means learning about another country.</br><br> How things are said in a language can say a lot about the people who speak it.</br>

      <h3>Class Information</h3>
      <p>
        The course will be designed to work on all four language skills: Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking. This will still include vocabulary and grammar rules as well.<br> I have taken TESOL courses on top of studying the other language. You need both to do any of the four skills as well.</br><br> I plan to make my classroom as immersive as possible. I will also have TESOL classes for specific topics that people can choose from.</br><br>The lessons will be in the range of beginner to intermediate learners, depending on where the capabilities of the students are. The great thing about the classes being online means that the course time will be flexible.</br><br> I will teach individual and group lessons which will allow for even more wiggle room for lesson time. I will have a minimum time limit of 15 minutes.</br><br> For this reason, my time slots will be given in 15 minute intervals to sign up for on my website. It can be as long as an hour, but could also be thirty or forty-five minutes.</br><br> I will encourage my potential students to do at least two lessons a week at least, but will still teach them even if that is not a possibility. Learning a language does take time so I will not do less than that.</br><br>The price of the lessons will depend on the amount of time.</br>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        It will  have some information about me to help the potential students feel more comfortable with me. My email will be in the contact information for people to ask me questions about the lessons or to schedule their lessons that way.<br> I have studied Spanish for about seven years and French for about three years. I have studied through school and go to conversation labs all the time that the university offers.</br><br> This helps with fluency. I have read books in Spanish and French to also help with fluency and comprehension.</br>
