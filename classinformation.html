            <h4 class="expectation">What a student would need to know about my classes:</h4>
            <p>The course will be designed to work on all four language skills: Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking. This will still include vocabulary and grammar rules as well.
            I have taken TESOL courses on top of studying the other languages. </p>
            <p>I plan to make my classroom as immersive as possible. I will also have TESOL classes for specific topics that people can choose from.
            The lessons will be in the range of beginner to intermediate learners, depending on where the capabilities of the students are. The great thing about the classes being online means that the course time will be flexible.
            I will teach individual and group lessons which will allow for even more wiggle room for lesson times. </p>
            <p>There will be a minimum time limit of 15 minutes, so my time slots will be at 15 minute intervals. It can be as long as an hour, but could also be thirty or forty-five minutes.
            I will encourage my potential students to do at least two lessons a week, but will still teach them even if that is not a possibility. Learning a language does take time so I will not do less than the 15 minute lessons.
            The price of the lessons will depend on the amount of time.</p>
